  Women are the backbone of silk production in North East India. They rear silkworms, harvest cocoons, spin thread, and weave the intricate textiles that carry centuries of cultural heritage. Yet they often lack control over the income their labor generates.

  Our women's empowerment program ensures female farmers and artisans have equal access to training, resources, and leadership opportunities—strengthening entire families and communities in the process.

    Anjali never attended community meetings—they were considered men's business. Though she worked longer hours than her husband in silk production, the income went into his pocket. She had no say in how it was spent.

    Today, Anjali leads a self-help group of 20 women, has her own bank account, and represents her village at district-level planning meetings. Her daughters see a different model of what women can achieve.
