  We believe dignified work is a fundamental human right. Our livelihoods program creates economic opportunities that allow families to thrive while maintaining their cultural identity and connection to ancestral crafts.

  Through fair-trade silk production, cooperative formation, and financial literacy training, we help artisan families break cycles of poverty without abandoning the traditions that define their communities.

    Meena Devi spent years weaving for middlemen who paid her barely enough to survive. Despite her exceptional skill, she had no control over prices or working conditions.

    After joining our cooperative program, Meena received training in quality standards and business management. Today, she leads a group of 12 weavers who sell directly to ethical brands, earning three times their previous income.
