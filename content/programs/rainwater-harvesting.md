  North East India receives abundant monsoon rainfall, yet water scarcity plagues communities during dry seasons. Climate change is making rainfall patterns increasingly unpredictable, threatening the water-intensive process of silk production.

  Our rainwater harvesting programs capture and store monsoon rains for year-round use. By combining traditional water conservation wisdom with modern engineering, we ensure that communities have reliable water access for mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, and household needs.

  title: "Water Security for Mulberry Farms"
  location: "Nagaon District, Assam"

    Every dry season, Priya Bora watched her mulberry plants wilt. Without water, the leaves became unsuitable for silkworms, and her family's income suffered. The nearest water source was a 2-kilometer walk away.

    With our rainwater harvesting program, Priya's community installed rooftop collection systems and a shared storage tank. Now, even in the driest months, she has water for her mulberry garden and silkworm rearing house.
