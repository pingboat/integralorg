overview_text: |
  Sustainable development only works when communities lead the way. We believe that lasting change comes from within — from communities that have the skills, resources, and confidence to shape their own futures.

  Our community building programs strengthen social bonds, preserve cultural heritage, and create platforms for collective action. We work alongside village councils, youth groups, and cultural organizations to build the social infrastructure that supports all other development efforts.

  title: "Reviving the Village Council"
  location: "Sualkuchi, Assam"
  content: |
    The traditional village council in Sualkuchi had become dormant, with decisions increasingly made by a few influential families. Young people felt disconnected from community affairs, and cultural practices were fading.

    Through our community building program, we worked with elders and youth together to revitalize the council. We facilitated intergenerational dialogues, documented traditional governance practices, and trained new leaders in inclusive decision-making.

    text: "For the first time, young people are attending council meetings. They're learning our traditions while bringing new ideas. The village feels united again."
