overview_text: |
  Soil is the living foundation of all agriculture. Decades of chemical fertilizers and intensive farming have depleted soils across North East India, reducing their ability to hold water, support beneficial organisms, and nourish plants.

  Our soil health programs restore this vital resource through organic practices, composting, and regenerative techniques. Healthy soil grows healthier mulberry, which feeds healthier silkworms, which produce higher-quality silk. It's a cycle of renewal that benefits farmers, communities, and the environment.

    Ranjan Kalita's mulberry garden had been declining for years. Despite increasing his use of chemical fertilizers, the leaves grew smaller and his silkworms produced less silk. A soil test revealed the problem: his soil was nearly lifeless.

    Through our soil health program, Ranjan learned to make vermicompost, planted nitrogen-fixing cover crops, and stopped using chemicals entirely. Within two years, his soil transformed — dark, crumbly, and full of earthworms.
