  For silkworm rearers and artisans, increasing productivity means producing more silk on the same land, creating higher-quality textiles, and reducing waste—all while maintaining ecological balance.

  We combine traditional knowledge with climate-adapted techniques to help farmers achieve better yields without compromising environmental health or product quality.

    Raju Bora had been rearing silkworms the same way his father taught him, but yields were declining each year. Climate unpredictability made traditional timing unreliable.

    Through our productivity program, Raju learned to read environmental cues and adjust his rearing schedule accordingly. Simple improvements to his rearing house ventilation and leaf storage nearly doubled his cocoon harvest.
