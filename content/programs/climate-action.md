  North East India is experiencing the impacts of climate change firsthand — erratic monsoons, intense flooding, prolonged droughts, and shifting seasons. For silk farming communities whose livelihoods depend on predictable weather patterns, these changes pose an existential threat.

  Our climate action programs help communities adapt to these new realities while reducing their environmental footprint. We combine indigenous weather knowledge with modern climate science, helping farmers anticipate changes and build resilience into their farming systems.

approach:
  - title: "Climate Assessment"
    description: "We analyze local climate trends and work with communities to understand how changes are affecting their lives and livelihoods."
  - title: "Indigenous Knowledge"
    description: "We document and revitalize traditional weather forecasting methods that have helped communities adapt to environmental changes for generations."
  - title: "Adaptive Practices"
    description: "We introduce climate-smart techniques — drought-resistant varieties, diversified farming, and flexible planting calendars — that reduce vulnerability."
  - title: "Carbon Sequestration"
    description: "Through agroforestry and soil restoration, we help farming systems absorb more carbon than they emit, contributing to global climate solutions."

    Gopal Nath's grandfather could predict the monsoon by watching bird migrations and tree flowering patterns. But as climate change disrupted these natural cycles, the old methods seemed less reliable. Farmers were caught off-guard by floods and droughts.

    Our climate action program brought together elders like Gopal's grandfather with climate scientists to update traditional forecasting. By combining indigenous indicators with modern weather data, the community developed a hybrid system that outperforms either approach alone.
