# Overview Section
overview_title: "Regenerating Nature for Sustainable Livelihoods"
overview_text: |
  Healthy ecosystems are the foundation of sustainable sericulture. We work with communities to restore degraded landscapes, protect native forests, and create biodiverse environments where silk farming can thrive alongside nature.

  Our approach recognizes that environmental health and economic prosperity are inseparable. When we regenerate mulberry forests, protect watersheds, and build biodiversity corridors, we're not just healing the land—we're securing livelihoods for generations to come.

# Approach Section

approach:
  - title: "Landscape Assessment"
    description: "We begin by mapping existing ecosystems, identifying degraded areas, and understanding the relationships between forests, water sources, and silk farming communities."
  - title: "Community-Led Restoration"
    description: "Local communities lead restoration efforts, combining indigenous knowledge with scientific methods. This ensures long-term stewardship and cultural connection to the land."
  - title: "Native Species Reforestation"
    description: "We prioritize native mulberry varieties and companion species that support biodiversity while providing optimal conditions for silkworm rearing."
  - title: "Ongoing Monitoring"
    description: "Regular ecological monitoring tracks forest health, biodiversity indicators, and water quality to ensure our interventions create lasting positive change."

  title: "Bringing Back the Forest in Majuli"
  location: "Majuli Island, Assam"
  content: |
    When we first visited Kamalabari village, the once-lush mulberry groves had been reduced to scattered patches. Annual floods and years of unsustainable harvesting had taken their toll.

    Working with village elders, we mapped the historical forest boundaries and identified native species that had thrived for generations. Over three years, the community planted 5,000 native mulberry and companion trees, creating a 50-hectare restoration zone.
