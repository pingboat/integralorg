overview_text: |
  Talented artisans often receive a fraction of what their work is worth because they lack direct access to markets that value quality and sustainability. Middlemen capture most of the value, leaving producers trapped in poverty.

  We bridge this gap by connecting rural silk producers to fair-trade networks, ethical brands, and direct sales channels that pay prices reflecting the true value of their craftsmanship.

  title: "From Local Market to International Brands"
  location: "Jorhat, Assam"

    The weavers of Titabor village produced exquisite Muga silk, but sold it at the local market for barely enough to cover their costs. They had no idea that the same silk, after passing through multiple middlemen, sold for 10 times the price in Delhi boutiques.

    After joining our market linkage program, the Titabor cooperative now supplies directly to three ethical fashion brands. They set their own prices based on true production costs plus fair profit margins.
