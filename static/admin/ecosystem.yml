title: "Beyond Silk: A Complete Ecosystem"
intro: "Integral Farming creates diversified, resilient livelihoods. Our artisan families produce multiple products from integrated farming systems—each supporting the others."
note: "This diversity means families aren't dependent on a single crop or market. When one product faces challenges, others sustain income. This is climate resilience in action."
